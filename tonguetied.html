                   <p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s strong statements and loose tongue may be tying those of the college students who support him.</p>
<p>Many local college students who back Trump express reluctance to voice their allegiance on college campuses. Unlike other candidates running for a party nomination, college Democrats condemn Trump for his conservative views while many college Republicans reject him for not being conservative enough.</p>
<p>Instead, he garners his support primarily from moderate Republicans who like Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;brutal honesty&rdquo;, immigration policy, and his status as a Washington outsider, according to Kevin Mullinix, a professor of government and justice studies at Appalachian State University. After reviewing papers for his classes, he estimates that a sizable amount of his students agree with Trump and many of his stances, particularly on immigration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sold himself very well on these things and he&rsquo;s very good at capitalizing on issues at the right time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Trump is even projected to win North Carolina&rsquo;s primary election.</p>
<p>But despite the support his students cite for Trump in their assignments and moderated in-class discussion, it is rare to find anything but anger or derision towards his vocal supporters on college campuses.</p>
<p>In response to a question to Yik Yak (an anonymous social media platform) asking how students would react upon discovering that a classmate supported Trump, one user recommended against it adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous. College libs will try to ruin your reputation and career prospects out of spite.&rdquo; A student in the Student Government Association even suggested that Trump supporters could be found &ldquo;in the sewers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s definitely been a lot of negative backlash,&rdquo; said Emily Montgomery, a 22-year-old political science major. &ldquo;I took a picture of me wearing a volunteer badge and a Trump hat and a friend commented on my Facebook and said &lsquo;Congratulations you&rsquo;re working for a bigot.&rsquo; I could see how people would be nervous to say that [they support Trump].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at campuses situated in some of North Carolina&rsquo;s most conservative areas, Trump supporters still face judgment from peers on campus, sometimes in person, but more often on social media.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s through Twitter messages, or even more commonly, we get attacked through our email,&rdquo; Ryan Fournier, a student and Trump organizer at Campbell University said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson, a 19-year-old freshman at Lenoir Rhyne and communications director for Students for Trump added, &ldquo;If you support Trump you&rsquo;re labeled as a racist or a bigot. I think that the liberals and the liberal media are good at labeling people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With pressure coming from the political left and right, it&rsquo;s difficult for these students to share their views. As political fervor increases in the coming months, Trump&rsquo;s collegiate supporters may have to develop a thick skin and look to polling numbers, not campus peers, for support.</p>
